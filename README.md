## Garden Exhange Readme

The Garden Exchange app is a simple mobile first interface that allows gardeners with an excess harvest of one vegetable to make it available to others for free or in trade.

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/kateflood/garden-exchange/wiki) for more information and updates.

Thanks.
